Important to mention:
- Increasing model complexity and computational Growth
- Memory bandwidth and capacity constraints
- Communication overheads in distributed and heterogeneous systems
Numerical precission, stability, and robust Execution
- Energy efficiency and thermal constraints
- Lack of transparent, fine-grained performance characterization
- Relevant Publications and Tools (NVIDIA Research, Citadel, JAX Scaling Book, etc.)
